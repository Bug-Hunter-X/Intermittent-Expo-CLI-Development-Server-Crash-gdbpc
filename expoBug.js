While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error message in the console. This was intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. It appeared to be related to a specific combination of using certain libraries and performing specific actions within the app, but pinpointing the exact cause was challenging.  The crash resulted in a complete shutdown of the development server, requiring a manual restart.
