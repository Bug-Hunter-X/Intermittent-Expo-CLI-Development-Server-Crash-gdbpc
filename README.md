# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates an issue where the Expo CLI development server crashes intermittently without providing clear error messages in the console. The crash is difficult to reproduce consistently and seems to be related to specific library interactions or app actions. 

## Problem Description
The Expo development server unexpectedly shuts down during development. The console does not provide useful error messages to pinpoint the cause.  A manual restart of the server is required to continue development.

## Steps to Reproduce
Reproducing this bug is challenging due to its intermittent nature.  The provided `expoBug.js` example includes components and actions that, in combination with other parts of a larger app, have been observed to trigger the crash. It's not guaranteed to reproduce the issue in isolation.

## Solution
The provided `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates a possible solution involving improved error handling, more cautious resource management (if applicable), and potentially alternative library choices.  This solution attempts to prevent or mitigate the crashes but does not guarantee a 100% fix because of the bug's inconsistent nature. Further investigation might be needed to identify the root cause precisely.

## Additional Notes
This bug is likely highly specific to certain project configurations, libraries, and actions.   Debugging it could require extensive logging, profiling, and perhaps experimentation with different libraries.
